## Summary
Introduction
In this analysis, I am assuming the position of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The task is to use the previous yearâ€™s rider data to investigate how casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bike differently in a bid to come up with recommendations for the company on how to encourage casual riders to become annual members.
